# Homework

- Create a repository for your class assignments. Make a [README.md](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/) - which can be very minimal to start - and add folders for your clock assignment and your They Live assignment.

Suggested repo structure:

```
ScriptingForTheWeb/
- README.md
clock/
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
bizzare-site/
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
```

- After you make your repository, see if you can make a pull request for me to add a link to your repository. You would copy

1. Make a **fork** of my class repository.
2. In your own fork (copy) of the repo, navigate to the [students page](https://github.com/lee2sman/Scripting_Spring2019/tree/master/students). <- Note I am linking to my copy, but you will want to edit your own version. You can either click the edit button OR download the entire repository to your computer, and then open the students/README.md page. Find your name, and add a link to your class repository. Note that these README.md files are written in Markdown so links look like this:

```
[link text](http://someWebsiteOrGitHubPage.com/)
```

Example

```
[Lee Tusman](https://github.com/lee2sman/Scripting_Spring2019/)
```

When you have done this you will add and commit this in your own forked copy. Try to follow [these steps for doing a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) so that I see and then pull in your changes.
