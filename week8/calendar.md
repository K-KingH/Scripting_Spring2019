# Project Calendar

# March 13

- Meeting in RAX 0137\
- Reading Group
- Intro Project : “Surface and the Depth of Time”
- Review References

Incubator Session:

- discussion group w/ question prompts
- prompts for synthesis from reading/project, leading toward team definition of “surface” and intended scope of project
- guided first steps on collaboratively
- exchange contact info, convo on individual schedules/commitments/obligations, show methods of working collaboratively in google drive/git

*Homework:*

1. Set up a collaborative workspace, review references, and designate a weekly time to meet up for homework outside of class. This process should include action items. Action items are the tasks individuals in the studio are accountable for. This should be written, so there is a transcription of accountability, in the form of a shared document/project schedule for the studio. Please email BOTH of us, cc’d with your WHOLE group, access to wherever this collaborative space is located.
2. Collaboratively begin defining scope of project (project sheet found on Moodle). This should be done in the spirit of brainstorming, in a collaborative space where your process is recorded and can be shared. I.E. This conversation should be transcribed/annotated in some way, in a shared space, so the studio can ultimately share it (as required above)
3. Create a pitch proposal for your collaborative project. As a team, prepare (and rehearse) a 10 minute pitch proposal/presentation. This should include at a minimum:
 - A summation of your collaborative brainstorming on possible thematics for this project. This summation must includes how the readings/references affected (or not) the trajectory of your groups discussion and ideation.
 - A summation (about 1 paragraph, written) which describes your groups proposed direction. What are you “saving”? Who will it be for? How will it structurally function? How will it conceptually function? What is the goal? What do you want to be experienced in 10 years?
 - A statement (on how your group is addressing “legacy” concerns. I.E. how are you designing for a surface to be both experienced today and in 10 years?
 -  A summation (written) of your group’s “game plan” which includes: 
   - initial details describing your group’s schedule to see the project through to completion.
   - initial details describing how the group is being accountable for distribution of work, the feasibility of the project in the given timeline, as well as how the group is working in the spirit of collaboration.
 -  Proof of beginning steps of production which (at a minimum) includes: visuals & content : like sketches, writing, diagrams, mock ups, etc…
    - a wire-flow diagram for this website which includes : all major/secondary/related tasks, call outs related to passive and active interactions, visualized pathways, and a name.
    - This diagram should be a “blueprint” for your project, and have a considered palette, typesetting, icons, etc…  this diagram should begin to give the “feel” of your projects visual identity and philosophy.

Within this “presentation”, you should consider how best to represent both visually and verbally the work you have done thus far. Do consider how do you make your research, thought process, and intended ideas accessible to an outside audience. Through this “presentation”you should illustrate your ideas and research where possible with appropriate diagrams, documentation, sketches, lists, etc…

# March 20

- Meeting in RAX 0137
- Pitch Proposals DUE for review

Studio Time:

- open studio time

*Homework:*

1.  Following feedback on your pitch, collaboratively reflect on what was said/brought up. As a group, what do you agree with and how are you going to take action to address the feedback and concerns? The articulation, research, scope, and/or manifestation of your project should adapt. This should be done in the spirit of discussion in a collaborative space where your process is recorded and can be shared.
2. Taking action on above, create a second draft, refined, wireflow diagram for your website which a wire-flow diagram for this website which finalizes : all major/secondary/related tasks, call outs related to passive and active interactions, visualized pathways, and a name. This diagram serves as a “blueprint” for your project, and must have a considered pallet, typesetting, icons, etc…  Again, this diagram should begin to give the “feel” of your projects visual identity/philosophy.
3. Move to actualization. For next week, in addition to a refined wireflow diagram, your group must have a functioning website ready to share. This should show:
  - your groups intended visual voice (color, interfaces, type styles, image Treatment, tone of language, etc...), 
  - strategies of interaction/engagement
  - strategies related to looking nice today as well as being accessible in 10 years
  - This should have actualized content (i.e. live copy)
