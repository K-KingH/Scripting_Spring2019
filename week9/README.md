# Live Collaborative Editing

While not its only feature, one of the standout elements of Google Docs is its strength in live multi-user editing. GitHub and other version control systems allow for live simultaneous editing on individual 'checked-out' local repositories. In this system, one is working on a local copy of a project, and then must merge code changes back into a master copy, resolving any consistencies.

But what if you want to work on code live simultaneously in the same document? GitHub leads work on the Integrated Development Environment [Atom](https://www.atom.io/), an open-source and free editor for coding in any language. Atom is minimal to start, modelled on the famous commercial Sublime Text editor. It works well out of the box and there are many easy-to-install free plugins so that you can customize the Atom editor to fit your needs should you need further functionality.

One plugin is called [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/), which lets coders share their workspace and collaborate on code together in real time. A Google Docs of coding!

#### How does Teletype work differently than Google Docs?

1. One person is the host. The files don't live in *the cloud*. They live on the host's computer, so the host starts the collaborative editing, must save changes made, and can close the project at any time, ending the collaboration.
2. If the host jumps to a different document, all collaborators inside the doc will be pulled into the new document simultaneously. They cannot work on the original document solo.

Basically, with Teletype whoever hosts is in charge of what document is being worked on.

#### To Install Teletype

1. Go to Atom > Preferences on a Mac. On A PC, open Settings.
2. Go to the Install tab.
3. Type in Teletype. Click install.
4. Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't already have an account.

Additional [info](https://atom.io/packages/teletype) or manually install Teletype.

#### To host a project for live editing in Teletype

1. The host should go click on the Antenna symbol in the bottom right Atom status bar.
2. The Host clicks to turn on the **Share** toggle.
3. The host copies the atom address and shares it with their collaborators, for example via messaging, email or Slack.
4. Collaborators can click on the address to open the document in their own Atom. All will be inside the current document together and able to edit. The document resides on the host's computer so that person should be sure to regularly save! If the host clicks over to another document, the collaborators will all jump into that document together.

**SAVE OFTEN!**

### Alternatives to Teletype

- Pair programming: One person on the keyboard. Another on the mouse. Each person takes turns coding, giving ideas, etc.
- Non-realtime collaboration: Collaborators use a GitHub local repository and merge their contributions together to the remote repository. In this model, each person works on their own forked copy of the project, then occasionally merge it into a master repository.
- Non-realtime collab in Glitch.com: Collaborators share a project on Glitch.com, which also hosts the project as a website or server. Collaborators can sign in and modify or add documents to this project. This is hosted *in the cloud* so there is only one master copy of the project that is being edited.

# Crit / Studio Feedback

Your group should listen attentively to the project pitch of your classmates. Studios should be proposing:

- A summation of your collaborative brainstorming on possible thematics for this project. This summation must includes how the readings/references affected (or not) the trajectory of your group's discussion and ideation.

- A summation (about 1 paragraph, written) which describes your groups proposed direction. What are you “saving”? Who will it be for? How will it structurally function? How will it conceptually function? What is the goal? What do you want to be experienced in 10 years?

- A statement (on how your group is addressing “legacy” concerns. I.E. how are you designing for a surface to be both experienced today and in 10 years?

# Conceptual Consultation with Lee/Kelsey

- What is the idea?
- How did you decide on your project?
- What is your group process?
- What roles are needed? How will you keep collaboration equitable and supportive? How will you/have you worked through challenges or make group decisions?
- What is your goal and timeline?
- What are your immediate next steps?
- What are your unknowns?

## Coding Challenges with Takashi and Amanda

Our wonderful TAs are Takashi and Amanda, both very knowledgeable with HTML, CSS and Javascript. They can provide assistance for technical challenges by guiding you to useful areas of research, best practices, and debugging ideas.

- What is your group's plan for the architecture and hosting of the site?
- How will you solve the technical challenges? What are you looking into?
- How does your server work?
- What technical questions do you have?

# Homework

Following feedback on your pitch, collaboratively reflect on what was said/brought up. As a group, what do you agree with and how are you going to take action to address the feedback and concerns? The articulation, research, scope, and/or manifestation of your project should adapt. This should be done in the spirit of discussion in a collaborative space where your process is recorded and can be shared.

Taking action on the above, create a second draft, refined,  a wireflow diagram for your website which finalizes : all major/secondary/related tasks, call outs related to passive and active interactions, visualized pathways, and a name. This diagram serves as a “blueprint” for your project, and must have a considered pallet, typesetting, icons, etc…  Again, this diagram should begin to give the “feel” of your projects visual identity/philosophy.

Move to actualization. For next week, in addition to a refined wireflow diagram, your group must have a functioning website ready to share.

- This should show your group's intended visual voice (color, interfaces, type styles, image Treatment, tone of language, etc...), strategies of interaction/engagement, and strategies related to looking nice today as well as being accessible in 10 years.

- This should have actualized content (i.e. live copy).
